🎬 Step-by-Step Guide: Creating Your First Project in Premiere Pro
🧩 Step 1: Open Premiere Pro

Launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The Home Screen will appear with two main options:
🔹 New Project
🔹 Open Project

Click on “New Project”.

🗂️ Step 2: Set Up Your Project

A dialog box appears — this is your Project Settings window.

Enter Details:

Project Name:
👉 Type your project’s name (e.g., My First Edit).

Location:
👉 Choose where to save your project file (.prproj).
It’s best to create a dedicated folder (e.g., Premiere Projects/MyFirstEdit).

Optional Settings:

You can leave other options (like Renderer, Scratch Disks) at default for now.

Click “Create” ✅

🎞️ Step 3: Import Your Media Files

You’re now inside the Editing Workspace.

To import:

Go to File → Import

Or simply drag and drop videos, music, or images into the Project Panel (bottom-left corner).

💡 Tip: Organize files into bins (folders) inside Premiere (like Videos, Audio, Images).

⏱️ Step 4: Create a Sequence

A sequence is where your actual editing happens (timeline).

There are two easy ways:

Drag a clip onto the timeline — Premiere will automatically create a matching sequence.

Or go to File → New → Sequence, then choose a preset (e.g., Digital SLR → 1080p → 30fps).

Rename your sequence (e.g., Main Edit).

✂️ Step 5: Start Editing

Now you can:

Trim clips: Drag the clip edges.

Split clips: Press C (Razor tool).

Move clips: Use the V tool (Selection).

Add transitions: Go to Effects → Video Transitions and drag between clips.

Add music: Drag audio into the lower audio tracks.

🎨 Step 6: Add Titles & Effects

For text: Go to Graphics → New Layer → Text or press T and click on the video preview.

For effects: Use the Effects Panel, search (e.g., “Gaussian Blur”), and drag it to a clip.

🔊 Step 7: Adjust Audio

Use the Audio Clip Mixer or Effect Controls to adjust volume.

Fade in/out using the pen tool or fade handles on audio clips.

💾 Step 8: Save Your Work

Press Ctrl + S (Windows) or Cmd + S (Mac) frequently to save progress.

📤 Step 9: Export Your Final Video

When you’re ready:

Go to File → Export → Media

Choose:

Format: H.264 (best for YouTube & social media)

Preset: Match Source – High Bitrate

Output Name: Set location and file name

Then click Export 🚀

🎉 Done!

You’ve successfully created and exported your first video project in Premiere Pro!
